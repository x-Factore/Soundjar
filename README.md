# Project concept
Soundjar is an app where people can share the songs they're listening to, and upvote/downvote others users shares. 


# What you can do/ cannot do.

You should be able to create an account.
You should be able to delete your account.
You should be able to edit your account.
You should be able to post songs while being connected to your account.
On each post, you should be able to listen to the song that is shared. (being redirected to youtube)
You can't upvote/downvote multiple times the *same* post.
You can't upvote/downvote/post without an *account*.

# Extra Ideas if we have time 

Add a comment/delete comment system.
Add a follow/unfollow system
Add a like comment/dislike comment system
Add a repost system (like retweet on Twitter)
